            Configuration History Page Feature, Developed at Entrust during my Internship
        </h1>
        <p>
            On an Entrust webpage I created a configuration history page which showed recent configuration settings which had been updated or created. 
            There was a drop down at the top of the page allowing for a time selection which specified how many hours to look back on. 
            This required me to build a backend call and create a new webpage styling the frontend to conform to the other page's style.

        <h1>
            Time Zone Choice Feature in Log and Audit Pages, Developed at Entrust during my Internship
        </h1>
        <p>
            On an Entrust webpage I added a configuration setting which describes time zones one can choose from. Whichever time zone is chosen dictates how time
            is displayed in logging and audit descriptions. This required interaction with moment.js and moment-timezone.js libraries.

            Finding the Pizza Slice in Artificial Intelligence

        <p>
            In my Artificial Intelligence class a couple years ago one of our assignments was to write the code for a game to be able to a slice of pizza in a
            room. We had a starting point and would search ad react based on where we'd already searched, the walls in the room, and if we could smell the
            pizza.
