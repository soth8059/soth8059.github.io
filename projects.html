                Configuration History Page Feature, Developed at Entrust during my Internship
            </h1>

            <p class="center cell small-12 medium-6">
                On an Entrust webpage I created a configuration history page which showed recent configuration settings which had been updated or created. 
                There was a drop down at the top of the page allowing for a time selection which specified how many hours to look back on. 
                This was helpful for situations when something broke because of configuration changes. This tool is a much more readable version of log files.
                This required me to build a backend call and create a new webpage styling the frontend to conform to the other page's style.

                Time Zone Choice Feature in Log and Audit Pages, Developed at Entrust during my Internship
            </h1>
            <p class="center cell small-12 medium-4">
                On an Entrust webpage I added a configuration setting which describes time zones one can choose from. Whichever time zone is chosen dictates how time
                is displayed in logging and audit descriptions. This required interaction with moment.js and moment-timezone.js libraries. 
                This project allows teams working in different time zones to have clarification for what time zone they are looking at when production, development 
                and the database are taking place across timezones.

                Finding the Pizza Slice in Artificial Intelligence
            </h1>
            <img class="center cell small-12 medium-6" src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.-CFtgkoyxdl4L54iDUkoegHaHa%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=418b657aff5684fb2c207cc89e64cf72d848785651e77cfa9a28d0dfb5e788f6&ipo=images" alt="pizza icon">
            <p class="center cell small-12 medium-6">
                In my Artificial Intelligence class a couple years ago one of our assignments was to write the code for a game to be able to a slice of pizza in a
                room. We had a starting point and would search ad react based on where we'd already searched, the walls in the room, and if we could smell the
                pizza.
