                At St. Thomas I've enjoyed being on the rowing team. It's extremely
                beautiful on the river and can be very fun to row the smaller, more efficient boats
                or ride in the bigger boats. However, the more people there are in a boat, the easier
                it becomes for even one person to throw the whole boat off.

                I never had any pets growing up, but a couple years ago we got 4 chickens and my dad
                built a coup for them all in the back yard. They are pretty good layers and we give
                eggs to our neighbors almost every week.

                I love Ireland. My mum was born there and it's a beautiful place. They are very environmentally
                concious, and really enjoy their sens eof humor. It can be very dry and many Americans can find
                it insulting but I love it. For anyone interested I highly recommend the TV show Derry Girls,
                it's on Netflix and set in the 80s.
